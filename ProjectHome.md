# Tangame #
## Description: ##
A puzzle game based on the popular Tangram puzzle, in which a silhouette is show and must be recreated using smaller shapes.

Manipulation of the pieces is done with the mouse with realistic physics.

Eventually custom puzzles, textures and possibly shapes will most likely be added.

In VERY early development, source may be difficult to compile.

Depends on [Chipmunk Physics](http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk) and [Gosu](http://code.google.com/p/gosu).
